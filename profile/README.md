## Overview

<a href="#">Glassnode for macOS</a> is aimed at traders and investors who treat on-chain data as a core part of their thesis. Instead of relying solely on price and volume, they examine cohort behaviour, realised value, supply dynamics and exchange flows to understand what participants are actually doing. Glassnode organises these signals into dashboards and metrics that can be explored without writing custom queries. This lowers the barrier to meaningful on-chain analysis while still allowing depth for advanced users.

Metrics are grouped into logical families so that users can compare related views side by side—long-term holder activity versus short-term speculation, profit versus loss, or supply on exchanges versus in self-custody. Chart overlays, custom ranges and <a href="#">saved workspaces</a> make it easier to turn one-off observations into repeatable monitoring routines. Annotating key inflection points helps teams remember why a metric mattered at specific moments in prior cycles.

On macOS, Glassnode aligns with other professional tools, favouring responsive charting, keyboard navigation and layouts that adapt well to external monitors. Analysts can keep it open on a dedicated screen as a kind of on-chain radar while trading from separate platforms. Over time, the combination of context, history and visual clarity makes it an anchor for understanding where we are in the broader lifecycle of a network, not just the current price swing.
